# What's in The Box?

FinTrack is a Python module at its core. Yet it is also usable from the command line thanks to Google's [Fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire).

FinTrack will allow you to:
* track income and expenses
* plan future/recurring income and expenses
* project known and planned income and expenses in the future
* keep a cashflow balance

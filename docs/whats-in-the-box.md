# What's in The Box?

FinTrack allows you to...

- track income and expenses (Fin - Track ðŸ˜‰)
- keep track of a balance
- plan future/recurring income and expenses
- project known and planned income and expenses in the future

At its core FinTrack is a Python module. Yet it is also usable from the command line thanks to Google's [Fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire), that exposes the module's classes as accessible objects.

Storage of the records and recurring schedules is done in a folder with JSON files. Once feature-complete, a Mongo backend will also be implemented as an option.

Also, once feature-complete a small web app will be included, besides the command line interface as a more attractive user interface.
